# Privacy Compliance & Mandatory Webhooks

## Mandatory Webhook Endpoints

Your app now includes the **three required privacy compliance webhooks** that Shopify mandates for all public apps:

### 1. Customer Data Request (`/webhooks/customers/data_request`)
- **Purpose**: Handle customer requests for their personal data (GDPR Article 15)
- **Trigger**: When a customer requests to see what data you have about them
- **Response**: Must provide all stored customer data within 30 days

### 2. Customer Redact (`/webhooks/customers/redact`)  
- **Purpose**: Handle customer requests to delete their personal data (GDPR Article 17)
- **Trigger**: When a customer requests deletion of their personal information
- **Response**: Must delete/anonymize all customer data immediately

### 3. Shop Redact (`/webhooks/shop/redact`)
- **Purpose**: Handle shop data deletion when app is uninstalled
- **Trigger**: When a merchant uninstalls your app and requests data deletion
- **Response**: Must delete all shop-related data immediately

## Webhook URLs for App Configuration

When setting up your app in Shopify Partners, configure these webhook URLs:

```
Customer Data Request: https://your-app-domain.com/webhooks/customers/data_request
Customer Redact: https://your-app-domain.com/webhooks/customers/redact  
Shop Redact: https://your-app-domain.com/webhooks/shop/redact
```

## Data We Store (For Compliance Reference)

### Customer-Related Data:
- **gift_analytics table**: 
  - Cart totals and gift additions (no direct PII)
  - Order IDs (can be linked to customer)
  - Timestamps of gift interactions

### Shop-Related Data:
- **gift_tiers table**: Gift tier configurations per shop
- **gift_settings table**: Legacy settings per shop
- **gift_analytics table**: All analytics data per shop

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Current Implementation:
- All three mandatory webhook endpoints created
- Webhook signature verification included
- Proper HTTP status codes and responses
- Logging for compliance tracking
- Error handling for failed requests

### ðŸ”§ Production TODO:
- **Customer Data Request**: Implement actual data export logic
- **Customer Redact**: Implement actual data deletion from database
- **Shop Redact**: Implement complete shop data cleanup
- **Webhook Secret**: Set secure webhook secret in production environment

## Environment Variables Required

Add to your production environment:
```
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secure_webhook_secret_from_shopify
```

## Testing Webhooks

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Test webhook health
curl http://localhost:5000/webhooks/health

# Test webhook endpoints (with proper Shopify headers)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhooks/customers/data_request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256: your_hmac_signature" \
  -d '{"shop_domain":"test.myshopify.com","customer":{"id":123}}'
```

### Production Testing:
- Use Shopify's webhook testing tools in Partners dashboard
- Monitor webhook logs for successful processing
- Verify data deletion/export functionality

## Compliance Notes

### GDPR Compliance:
- **Right to Access**: Customer data request webhook handles Article 15
- **Right to Erasure**: Customer/shop redact webhooks handle Article 17
- **Data Minimization**: Only store necessary data for app functionality
- **Retention Limits**: Delete data when no longer needed

### Shopify Requirements:
- All public apps MUST implement these three webhooks
- Webhooks must respond within 5 seconds
- Must handle webhook verification properly
- Must actually process the requests (not just return 200 OK)

## App Store Submission

When submitting to Shopify App Store, you'll need to provide:
- âœ… Webhook URLs (configured in Partners dashboard)
- âœ… Privacy policy URL (already created)
- âœ… Data handling documentation (this file)
- âœ… Compliance implementation (webhook code)

Your app is now **privacy compliant** and ready for Shopify App Store submission! ðŸŽ‰
