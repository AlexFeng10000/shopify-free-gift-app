# App Bridge Integration Debug Guide

## 🔗 Current Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Our Shopify app now includes full App Bridge integration with debugging capabilities.

## 📍 Deployment URLs

- **Main App**: `https://gift-booster-oc15gc8to-alexfeng10000s-projects.vercel.app/`
- **Test Page**: `https://gift-booster-oc15gc8to-alexfeng10000s-projects.vercel.app/app-bridge-test.html`

## 🧪 Test Results

### Outside Shopify (Expected Behavior)
When accessing the app directly (not through Shopify admin):
- ❌ App Bridge is not available
- ❌ App Bridge not initialized  
- ❌ Session token not available
- URL parameters: shop, host, hmac = not provided

**This is CORRECT behavior** - App Bridge only works within Shopify's iframe.

### Inside Shopify (Expected Behavior)
When the app is loaded within Shopify admin panel:
- ✅ App Bridge should be available
- ✅ App Bridge should initialize successfully
- ✅ Session token should be obtained
- URL parameters should include shop, host, and hmac

## 🔍 Debug Features

### 1. Visual Status Display
The main app shows real-time App Bridge status:
```
🔗 App Bridge Status
App Bridge Available: ✅/❌
App Bridge Initialized: ✅/❌  
Session Token: ✅/❌
```

### 2. Console Logging
Check browser console for debug messages:
- "🔗 Initializing App Bridge..."
- "✅ Session token obtained"
- "⚠️ App Bridge initialization failed: [error]"

### 3. Test Page
Visit `/app-bridge-test.html` for standalone testing that shows:
- App Bridge availability
- Initialization attempts
- URL parameter analysis

## 🛠 Implementation Details

### App Bridge Script Loading
```html
<!-- In client/public/index.html -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@shopify/app-bridge@3"></script>
```

### App Bridge Detection
```javascript
// In AuthWrapper.js
let AppBridge;
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.ShopifyAppBridge) {
  AppBridge = window.ShopifyAppBridge;
}
```

### Initialization Logic
```javascript
if (shop && host && AppBridge && !appBridge) {
  const app = AppBridge.createApp({
    apiKey: '0a84e1df4c003abfab2f61d8344ea04b',
    host: host,
    forceRedirect: true
  });
  
  const sessionTokens = AppBridge.authenticatedFetch(app);
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps for Testing

1. **Install in Shopify Store**: The app needs to be installed in a real Shopify store to test App Bridge functionality

2. **Check Admin Panel**: Access the app from within the Shopify admin to see App Bridge status change to ✅

3. **Monitor Console**: Watch for successful initialization messages

4. **Test API Calls**: Once App Bridge is working, test authenticated API calls using the session token

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### App Bridge Not Available
- Ensure the app is accessed through Shopify admin, not directly
- Check that the App Bridge script is loaded in the HTML

### Initialization Fails
- Verify the API key matches your Shopify app
- Check that host parameter is properly encoded
- Ensure the app URL is whitelisted in Shopify app settings

### Session Token Issues
- App Bridge must be initialized first
- Check browser console for authentication errors
- Verify the app has proper OAuth scopes

## ✅ Verification Checklist
