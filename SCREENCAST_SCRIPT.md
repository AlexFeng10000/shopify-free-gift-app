# Shopify Multi-Tier Gift App - Screencast Script

## Video Structure (6-7 minutes total)

### Opening (30 seconds)
**Screen**: App dashboard
**Narration**: 
"Welcome to Gift Booster, the most advanced gift-with-purchase app for Shopify. Unlike simple single-threshold apps, Gift Booster offers unlimited gift tiers that automatically reward customers at multiple spending levels, dramatically increasing your average order value. Let me show you how this powerful system works."

### Section 1: Dashboard Overview (45 seconds)
**Screen**: Main dashboard showing gift tiers
**Actions**:
1. Show clean dashboard interface
2. Point out gift tier configuration display
3. Highlight analytics overview
4. Show active/inactive tier status

**Narration**:
"The dashboard gives merchants a complete overview of their gift tier strategy. You can see all configured tiers at a glance, track performance metrics, and manage everything from one central location. Notice how we can have multiple tiers active simultaneously - this is what sets Gift Booster apart from basic gift apps."

### Section 2: Creating Multi-Tier Gift Strategy (90 seconds)
**Screen**: Gift Tiers management page
**Actions**:
1. Click "Manage Gift Tiers" button
2. Show empty state, then click "Add Tier"
3. Create Tier 1: $25 threshold â†’ Sticker Pack
4. Add Tier 2: $50 threshold â†’ Branded Keychain  
5. Add Tier 3: $100 threshold â†’ Premium Tote Bag
6. Show product selection dropdowns
7. Add descriptions for each tier
8. Activate all tiers
9. Show customer experience preview

**Narration**:
"Here's where the magic happens. Instead of just one gift threshold, we can create multiple tiers that reward customers at different spending levels. Let's set up a progressive reward system: $25 gets a sticker pack, $50 adds a keychain, and $100 includes a premium tote bag. Notice how customers get ALL gifts they qualify for - so a $100 purchase receives all three items. This creates powerful incentives to spend more."

### Section 3: Advanced Tier Management (60 seconds)
**Screen**: Gift Tiers interface with multiple tiers
**Actions**:
1. Show tier reordering capability
2. Demonstrate activating/deactivating individual tiers
3. Edit tier thresholds and products
4. Show validation (duplicate thresholds)
5. Display tier sorting by amount
6. Save all changes

**Narration**:
"Managing multiple tiers is intuitive. You can easily reorder tiers, activate or deactivate specific levels for testing, and modify thresholds on the fly. The system automatically sorts tiers by spending amount and prevents duplicate thresholds. This flexibility lets merchants optimize their strategy based on customer behavior and seasonal promotions."

### Section 4: Customer Experience - Progressive Rewards (90 seconds)
**Screen**: Simulated storefront/cart experience
**Actions**:
1. Show cart with $20 worth of items (no gifts)
2. Add $10 item to reach $30 (still under $25 minimum)
3. Add $5 item to reach $35 â†’ Sticker pack appears
4. Add more items to reach $55 â†’ Keychain added
5. Add premium item to reach $105 â†’ Tote bag added
6. Show final cart with all three gifts
7. Display clear messaging about earned rewards

**Narration**:
"The customer experience is where multi-tier rewards really shine. Watch as customers add items to their cart - at $25, they earn the sticker pack. At $50, the keychain is automatically added. And when they hit $100, they receive the premium tote bag too. Customers see exactly what they've earned and what's available at the next level, creating a gamified shopping experience that drives higher order values."

### Section 5: Analytics & Performance Tracking (75 seconds)
**Screen**: Analytics dashboard
**Actions**:
1. Return to main dashboard
2. Show updated tier performance metrics
3. Display conversion rates by tier
4. Show revenue impact of multi-tier strategy
5. Point out average order value increase
6. Demonstrate tier-specific analytics

**Narration**:
"Back on the dashboard, merchants can track the performance of their multi-tier strategy. See how each tier performs - which thresholds drive the most conversions, how much the average order value has increased, and the total revenue impact. This data helps merchants optimize their tier structure. For example, if the $50 tier has low conversion, they might adjust it to $45 or change the gift to something more appealing."

### Section 6: Business Impact & ROI (45 seconds)
**Screen**: Dashboard with key metrics highlighted
**Actions**:
1. Highlight key performance indicators
2. Show before/after AOV comparison
3. Display customer satisfaction metrics
4. Show mobile-responsive design
5. Demonstrate easy tier activation/deactivation

**Narration**:
"The results speak for themselves. Multi-tier gift strategies help increase average order value compared to single-threshold systems. Customers love the progressive rewards, merchants see higher revenue, and the gamified experience increases customer satisfaction. The system works perfectly on mobile devices and can be adjusted in real-time based on performance data."

### Closing (30 seconds)
**Screen**: Dashboard overview showing all active tiers
**Narration**:
"Gift Booster transforms the simple concept of gift-with-purchase into a sophisticated revenue optimization tool. With unlimited gift tiers, progressive rewards, and detailed analytics, it's the most advanced solution for increasing average order value on Shopify.
